The script for the course project is called run_analysis.R. Use:
* Download and unzip the course project's data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
* Start R with the working directory being the directory of the unzipped data, i.e. 'UCI HAR Dataset'.
* Source the run_analysis.R script. Assuming it is in the directory above, exectute `source("../run_analysis.R")`
* This will produce the required output file as "averages.txt" in the current working directory.
